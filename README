scepplugin.so - A SCEP authorization plugin that implements the RSA Certificate
Manager SCEP plugin interface and authorizes SCEP requests using passwords
embedded in SCEP GetCert messages.

Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt; the bcrypt libraries are ported from 
the bcrypt implementation at http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/

The plugin supports RSA Certificate Manager 6.8, build 520.

Password entries are stored in a passdata file that has the following format:

---
192.168.100.136
$2a$12$XPIBTErUF1GdiS3syFIPReyDmhk5BCxBGIOGTh/3WrV6asL8OQaHm
---

The IP address acts as a username for the SCEP request; this is the source IP address
of the packet that contains the SCEP request.

See the RSA Certificate Manager documentation for instructions on setting up the plugin.
